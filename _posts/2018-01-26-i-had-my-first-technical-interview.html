    <p>A few days ago a fellow student in
        <a href="https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Udacity's Grow with Google Scholarship</a> program told me about a site called
        <a href="https://www.pramp.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Pramp</a>. As their "About Us" page will tell you, "Pramp pairs software developers together for live practice interviews
        based on their professional background, availability and practicing needs."</p>
    <p>I thought I'd give it a shot and let you know how it went.</p>
    <p>After signing up and filling out a short questionnaire about my area of study (frontend) and skill level (beginner),
        I made an appointment for an available slot in their calendar. A little while later, I received an email telling
        me that Pramp had paired me with someone.</p>
    <p>The interview took place a couple of days later via video chat. My paired partner and I used Pramp's realtime collaborative
        code editor to watch each other work. Pretty cool. Pramp had provided each of us a problem to present when it was
        our turn to play interviewer. We were also given hints and a complete solution to the problem. That way, the interviewer
        could provide the interviewee a bit of coaching when they got stuck.</p>
    <p>Neither of us had been in a actual technical interview, and we didn't have much idea what we were doing. I was a bit
        nervous and asked if I could take on the interviewer role first. The problem was pretty tough. My partner had some
        good ideas, but wasn't quite able to get to a solution. I'd spent an hour the night before going over the problem
        and I hadn't been able to solve it either. </p>
    <p>I went next. By this point, I'd gotten over most of my jitters. My problem wasn't as tough as my partners, but I still
        wasn't able to get to the preferred solution. My partner did his best to coach me, but I just didn't have the background
        necessary. I could easily provide the brute force solution, but wasn't able to implement the algorithm that would
        have satisfied the problem's constraints. Good to know! I guess I need to work on algorithms.</p>
    <p>The interview was about an hour long. Once it was over, Pramp popped up a questionnaire and we each provided detailed
        feedback about the other's interview performance and about interviewing style.</p>
    <p>What I found most valuable about this experience was being put on the spot and forced to perform in front of one of my
        peers. It was just as nerve-wracking as it sounds. Which is sort of the point. Code Wars, Leet Code, Hacker Rank,
        etc. are great, and they'll help you learn what you need to learn to solve the kinds of problems you'll encounter
        in a real interview. What they won't do is prepare you for the experience of being interviewed. There's nothing quite
        like it: the butterflies, the clammy hands, the "oh, shit" realization that you're about to judged by someone you
        just met on your prowess as a programmer. It takes time and practice to become accustomed to those feelings and to
        gain the confidence that you can perform. Pramp provides a means to do that.</p>
    <p>I'll be using Pramp again, and frequently.</p>
