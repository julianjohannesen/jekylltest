I spent the last twelve and a half years working for a small, Boston-based nonprofit called Nonprofit VOTE. The organization's mission is to work with 501(c)(3) nonprofit service providers and community-based organizations to help the people they serve become active participants in our democracy. As Director of Research and Training I created new training materials and other resources to assist nonprofits in integrating civic and voter engagement into their ongoing services.

While at Nonprofit VOTE, I was also head technology and web development in which capacity I've spearheaded the expansion of our online presence and oversaw development of our websites and online tools. You can read more about my work at Nonprofit Vote on [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianjohannesen/).

In October of 2017, I began exploring a career switch to web development with a special interest in 
    civic tech. I enrolled in a night course at First Step Coding, an 8-week introduction to JavaScript 
    fundamentals. While at First Step, I became increasingly confident in my ability to successfully 
    transition into this new career, and in January of 2018, I left Nonprofit VOTE and pursue re-training 
    full-time.
